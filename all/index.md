# List of All the Things

So, you really want to know all the tech, tools and other things I've ever used, touched or have an otherwise informed opinion on? Very well, but first you need to suffer through this dislaimer:

- I'm not listing anything I just heard or glanced at, or we'll be here all day. Everything listed here I can tell you something about for a few minutes (or probably much, much longer).
- I'm not sorting this by anything. Yet. Maybe I'll do a tier list for fun someday. For now you'll get the order in which names pop into my head
- I'll try to add a version number or year. If I remember. I probably won't.
- I'm not gonna do much research on this list, this is all off the top of my dome.
- I am generally a strong believer that given time, any good software engineer can learn any language, framework or tool. I also think there are better or worse choices for any given problem and knowing many different techs and approaches will help making better choices. The initial cost of "oh, new shiny toy" is real though and rarely worth it. Stick to what the team knows for boring problems.

Are you still here? Okay, let's go.
